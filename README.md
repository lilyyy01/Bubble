Web Development Project
Bubble is Vanderbilt University's web development architecture team project, crafted to enhance networking and social integration for university alumni as they transition to new urban environments post-graduation. Developed using cutting-edge technologies like React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript, and designed with a sleek user interface via Figma, Bubble provides a dynamic platform for alumni to connect within their new communities. Our backend, powered by MongoDB and secured with NextAuth.js, ensures efficient data management and reliable authentication. By incorporating AI-driven content, Bubble aims to reduce relocation stress and amplify professional and social opportunities for recent graduates.
